# simple-2d-path-finding

Realization of the simple pathfinding algorithm in 2d space with the console's visualization.

<b>Input parameters:</b> 

<b>unsigned char* Map</b> - contains state of each cell in the world where 1 - is empty available cell and 0 - means an obstacle and is unavailable for path calculation
<p><b>int MapWidth, int MapHeight</b>- the size of the map
<p><b>int StartX, int StartY</b> - indexes of the start cell in the 2-dimensions array
<p><b>int TargetX, int TargetY</b> - indexes of the final cell in the 2-dimensions array
<p><b>int* OutPath</b> - list of calculated path's indexes in the 2-dimensions array
